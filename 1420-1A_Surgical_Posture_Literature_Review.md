- Introduces the term Work-Related Musclosketal Disorders  (WMSD)
- Surgeon WMSDs are prevalent, with rates ranging from 66% to 94% for open surgery, 73% to 100% for conventional laparoscopy, 54% to 87% for vaginal surgery, and 23% to 80% for robotic-assisted surgery.
- " little attention owing to under-reporting of injury and logistical constraints of studying surgical ergonomics"

- Psychophysical reeducation of the body to improve postural balance and coordination, permitting movement with minimal strain and maximum ease
- Small pilot study 7 people - claims to have shown benefit - but tiny study and need time line
- "Improved surgical ergonomics, endurance and posture decrease surgical fatigue and the incidence of repetitive stress injuries to laparoscopic surgeons"
