Question - Were we informed enough about our healthy posture in operation theatre and its impact on our health, in our  early days in surgery training? 								

Description - A big number of surgical trainees, donâ€™t know much about their healthy posture in an operation theatre. Unfortunately most do not seem informed enough earlier in their surgical career and can have a potentially serious impact on their physical health. Symptoms include neck pain, back pain, nerve entrapment, muscle wasting and results in chronic absences from work or even change of career. We will try to survey and at the end try to make some awareness booklets/ leaflets on proper surgical posture.
